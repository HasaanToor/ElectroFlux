## Project Idea
My plan is to make a game, there will be a grid like map on which houses/building tiles will spawn in periodically and your goal is to strategically place power production buildings (such as windmills or hydropower plants that have to be next to water tiles for example) to accommodate the power requirements of the houses, the game will end if you fail to power the houses for a predetermined amount of time.

## UN Sustainable Development Goals
* SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy
* SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production

## Project Background/Business Opportunity
I believe that by creating this game and covering SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy as well as SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, I encourage users to educate themselves about the future of energy and how we can consider the more widespread use of sustainable energy production sources. At the same time I hope it teaches the users about responsible power consumption and ways to reduce unnecessary it in our daily lives. 

As for the why/need of the project idea, while there are a few games out there that are similar in terms of power management, those games are more meant for entertainment purposes as they usually consist of fictional simulated cities with extravagant events and circumstances as again they focus on being a lot more fun than focusing on the educational aspect. So I believe my idea will be a good balance of fun and educational content to get the user to think about the future of our energy situation.
